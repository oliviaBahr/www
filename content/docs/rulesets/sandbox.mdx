description: Experimental ruleset for testing balance changes and new mechanics
---

## Overview

Sandbox tests mechanical changes that reshape how you approach the game. Score preview disabled. Modified jokers force different strategic choices. Three experimental stakes. Changes based on Standard ruleset.

## Gameplay Changes

- **Comeback Gold Mechanic:** $3 per completed Ante (was $4 per life lost)
- **Score Preview:** Disabled - removes calculation paralysis, speeds up play
- **Glass Cards:** Justice back in Tarot pool, glass cards break at 1/3 rate
- **Modified Content:** 12 jokers, 2 spectral cards, 3 tags, 3 new stakes - see below

## Tags
- **Gambling Tag**: Replaces Rare Tag. 1/2 chance for free Rare Joker next shop
- **Juggle Tag**: +3 hand size next PvP Blind (changed from affecting next blind to specifically targeting PvP blinds)
- **Investment Tag**: After defeating Boss Blind, gain $5 + $10 per completed Ante (scales with progression instead of flat $25)
## Glass Cards

Justice is back in the Tarot pool. Glass cards now break at **1/3 rate** (instead of 1 in 4).

## Stakes

Sandbox runs a custom stake rotation designed for cleaner difficulty progression.

**Available Stakes:**
- **White Stake** - Base difficulty
- **Black Stake** - Shop can have Eternal Jokers
- **Planet Stake** (NEW) - Applies Black Stake effects, plus:
  - Shop can have Perishable Jokers (debuffed after 5 Rounds)
  - Required score scales faster for each Ante
- **Spectral Stake** (NEW) - Applies Planet Stake effects, plus:
  - Rental Jokers appear in shop
  - Required score scales faster for each Ante (cumulative with Planet)
- **Spectral+ Stake** (NEW) - Applies Spectral Stake effects, plus:
  - Required score scales even faster for each Ante

**Design Notes:**
Each stake introduces one sticker type (Eternal → Perishable → Rental) with increasingly aggressive ante scaling. Discard reduction from vanilla Blue Stake removed entirely.

## Multiplayer Jokers

All multiplayer jokers from the Standard ruleset are included and available in Sandbox. See [Standard ruleset](/docs/rulesets/standard#multiplayer-jokers) for details.

<Callout>
## Why These Changes?

Balatro's single-player balance creates optimization-heavy competitive play where players calculate through 5-second score previews. Sandbox rebalances around faster decisions and strategic variety.

Score preview removal forces pattern recognition over arithmetic. Modified jokers create new constraints - Castle locks to one suit, Loyalty Card demands hand monogamy, Hit the Road permanently destroys Jacks. Spectral card changes remove permanent penalties that made cards like Ouija and Ectoplasm unplayable. Stakes progression separates sticker types across difficulties instead of stacking them on Gold Stake.
